## Abacus

The **abacus** is an ancient tool used for performing mathematical calculations. It consists of a frame with rods or wires on which beads are strung. The beads are moved up and down the rods to represent numbers and perform calculations.

The abacus has been used for thousands of years, with its origins likely dating back to Mesopotamia around **2700–2300 BC**. It was used throughout the ancient world, including in Egypt, Greece, Rome, China, and Japan. In Europe, the abacus fell out of favor after the introduction of the Hindu-Arabic numeral system in the Middle Ages. However, it is still used in some parts of the world today, particularly in China and Japan.

## Napier’s Bones

**John Napier** (1550–1617), a Scottish mathematician, created a set of “rods” or “bones” used by merchants to multiply two numbers.

- The **first number** is single digit.  
- The **second number** is formed by arranging appropriate rods for each digit.  
- Add numbers in diagonal columns to multiply.

## Napier’s Bones Example

**The sample shown** demonstrates how to multiply **35 by 2**. The first digit is 0 and then the 6 and 1 are added to form 7 as the second digit, thus **35 × 2 = 70**.

**The sample shown** demonstrates how to multiply **35 by 4**. The first digit is 0 and then the 2 and 2 are added to form 4 as the second digit, and 1 is the third digit, thus **35 × 4 = 140**.

**The sample shown** demonstrates how to multiply **35 by 9**. The first digit is 5 and then 4 and 4 are added to form 11. In this case we use 1 as the second digit, carry the other 1 adding it to 2 giving 3 as the third digit, thus **35 × 9 = 315**.

## Slide Rule

The **slide rule** was developed primarily by English mathematician and clergyman **Reverend William Oughtred** in the early 17th century. He drew inspiration from the emerging work on logarithms by John Napier, who had invented logarithmic scales for calculation.

## Log Tables

Use logarithms. Multiply and divide by adding/subtracting numbers in a lookup table. Used before calculators were widely available.

## 1800’s — Babbage and Lovelace

**Charles Babbage** (1837–1871) is given credit for the “idea” of a mechanical computer.

- Babbage created the **Difference Engine**, a single-purpose automatic mechanical calculator for polynomial functions.
- Babbage designed (but never fully created) the **Analytical Engine**, which many consider the first **general-purpose mechanical computer**.

**Ada Lovelace** is considered the “**first programmer**” as she wrote program instructions for Babbage’s Analytical Engine.

## 1800’s — Jacquard and Hollerith

**Joseph Jacquard** was a French inventor who revolutionized the textile industry with a programmable loom using **punch cards** that laid the foundation for storing data in early computers.

**Herman Hollerith** won the contract for the **1890 census**, processing data using sets of “punched cards.” His company later became **International Business Machines (IBM)**.
