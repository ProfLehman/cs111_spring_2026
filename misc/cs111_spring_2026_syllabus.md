## Active Course Engagement (10%)

Active Course Engagement is vital for success in this course. Weekly readings and videos present the course material and provide the background needed to complete assignments and prepare for exams. Students are responsible for reading all assigned materials and viewing the course videos. Students are encouraged to take notes summarizing topics covered in readings, videos, and class sessions (in-person). Students are encouraged to utilize office hours and send questions via email and text.

Most weeks include required **Discussion Questions** in a Moodle discussion forum. Each discussion will ask students to respond to several questions. Posts should show critical thinking and original perspectives. Some weeks require a second post. Responding to peers is encouraged. All conversations must be respectful. Completion is part of your Active Course Engagement grade. See Moodle for deadlines. Late posts do not receive credit. 

**Active Course Engagement grades** are recorded after each exam: 30 points after Exam #1, 30 points after Exam #2, and 40 points after Exam #3. Scores are based on attendance and in-class work (in-person only), weekly assignments, discussion posts, a participation self-reflection, and the instructor’s observations.


### Attendance (In-Person Only)

In-person class sessions enable you to engage with the material, providing opportunities to ask questions, participate in discussions, and work through assignments with instructor support.

Attendance is recorded at the beginning of class. Students are expected to attend all class sessions, arrive on time, stay actively engaged, complete all in-class assignments, refrain from using phones/computers for non-course purposes, and remain in class for the entire session (except during breaks for emergencies). Late arrivals, early departures, and taking breaks during class may be treated as partial or full absences. 

Huntington University policy requires students to attend at least two-thirds (2/3) of scheduled class sessions in a face-to-face course. **Students who miss one-third or more of class meetings will automatically fail the course.** This total includes excused absences for athletics, music, other university activities, or illness. Students are responsible for all material they miss.

If you arrive late or need to leave early, use the door opposite the instructor (SH 175) workstation and do so quietly. Attending part of a session is better than missing entirely.

Do not attend class if you are sick. Your health and the health of others comes first.

If you miss class, please get in touch with Prof. Lehman. Students who miss multiple sessions may be referred to Student Services, the Dean’s Office, or the Registrar for support.

## Weekly Assignments (45%)

Weekly Assignments are a central part of **Active Course Engagement** in this course. They are designed to help you practice new concepts, apply what you are learning, and reflect on your progress throughout the semester.

**Weekly Assignments are worth between 25 and 35 points per week, for a total of 450 points, which equals 45% of the final course grade.**

Most weeks include **three components**, each supporting a different aspect of learning.

### 1. Competency Check (approximately 20%)

Competency Checks focus on understanding key concepts from the week’s readings, videos, discussions, and class activities. These are typically completed in Moodle and may include multiple-choice, true/false, matching, or short-answer questions.

* Competency Checks provide timely feedback to help you monitor your understanding
* Multiple attempts may be allowed before the deadline
* These questions are similar in style to exam questions and help reinforce core concepts

Competency Checks are intended to support learning and preparation rather than function as high-stakes assessments.

### 2. Weekly Artifact (approximately 70%)

The Weekly Artifact is the primary hands-on component of the assignment and carries the greatest weight. Artifacts require you to actively apply course concepts and demonstrate practical skills.

Depending on the topic, artifacts may include:

* Running or modifying an existing program
* Writing a short program or script
* Creating or editing a document, spreadsheet, or webpage
* Demonstrating correct use of a computing tool or concept

Artifacts emphasize **engagement, effort, and demonstrated understanding**, not just final output. Clear instructions and examples will be provided, and partial progress is often valued as part of the learning process.

### 3. Reflection (approximately 10%)

Reflections provide an opportunity to pause and think about your learning. These short written responses ask you to describe what you learned, what challenged you, and how the week’s material connects to broader course goals or real-world applications.

* Reflections should be thoughtful but concise
* Reflections must be submitted **on time**
* Late reflections are generally not accepted, as reflection is most meaningful when it occurs during the learning process


### Weekly Due Dates and Late Work

Success in this course depends on steady participation and consistent effort rather than last-minute work. Weekly assignments are intended to be worked on throughout the week as part of regular course engagement.

Unless otherwise noted, **all components of the Weekly Assignment (Competency Check, Artifact, and Reflection) are due by Monday at 5:00 pm Indiana (Eastern) Time**.  In Arizona this is 3:00 pm. (before March 8th) and 2:00 pm. (March 8th and after)

Students are encouraged to ask questions during class meetings, office hours, or earlier in the week. Questions submitted over the weekend may not receive a response until Monday. Students in other time zones should plan accordingly.

- Assignments must be submitted through Moodle unless otherwise instructed.  
- Late work is accepted up to **48 hours after the deadline with a 10% penalty per assignment** (based on the total points for that assignment), unless otherwise noted.  
- Reflections are intended to capture your thinking during the learning process. Because their value depends on timing, reflections must be submitted on time and are generally not accepted late.
- In cases of extreme hardship or documented circumstances, students should notify the instructor as soon as possible.  
- Grades will be posted in Moodle. Students are responsible for reviewing their work and reporting discrepancies promptly.

## Academic Honesty and Plagiarism

Integrity is essential. Plagiarism includes submitting work that is not your own, copying answers, failing to cite sources, using AI when prohibited, or treating individual assignments as group work.

Consequences may include a failing assignment grade, failure of the course, and referral to the Academic Dean.

Plagiarism is using another’s ideas, information, or wording without proper acknowledgment. All quoted, paraphrased, or summarized material must be cited. Common knowledge is the only exception.

---

## AI Statement

This course permits AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Grammarly) to assist with learning and development.

Students may use AI to:
- Understand concepts  
- Receive feedback on writing  
- Debug code  
- Generate practice problems  

Students must understand and be able to explain all submitted work. AI tools are **not allowed on exams**.

Assignments will include AI usage guidelines:
- **Red:** No AI use  
- **Yellow:** Limited/cautious use  
- **Green:** AI freely allowed  

Improper AI use is considered cheating and/or plagiarism.
