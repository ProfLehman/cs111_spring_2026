## Grading

Each course component is worth a specific number of points. The percentage of total points determines the final grade. 
The instructor reserves the right to adjust assignments and points while maintaining overall percentage weightings.

| Component                         | Points | Percent |
|-----------------------------------|--------|---------|
| Weekly Assignments (x14)          | 450    | 45%     |
| Discussion Questions (x10)        | 100    | 10%     |
| Exams (x3)                        | 450    | 45%     |
| **Total**                         | **1000** | **100%** |

### Grading Scale

- **A:** 93.0+  
- **A-:** 90.0–92.9  
- **B+:** 88.0–89.9  
- **B:** 83.0–87.9  
- **B-:** 80.0–82.9  
- **C+:** 78.0–79.9

## Attendance & Participation

Attendance and participation are vital to your success. Weekly in-person sessions allow you to engage with the material, ask questions, and work through assignments.

Attendance is recorded for each class and posted on Moodle. Grades are recorded as follows:

- 30 points after Exam #1  
- 30 points after Exam #2  
- 40 points after Exam #3  

Your attendance record, in-class assignments, and instructor observations inform the grade.

To earn full credit, you must:

- Attend all class sessions and arrive on time  
- Stay actively engaged in discussions and activities  
- Complete all in-class work  
- Avoid using phones or computers for non-class purposes  
- Remain for the whole session, limiting breaks to emergencies  

If you arrive late or need to leave early, please use the door opposite the teacher workstation (Room 175) and do so quietly. Attending part of a session is better than missing entirely.

If you must miss a class, notify Prof. Lehman by email as soon as possible. Do not attend class if you are sick. Students participating in university-approved events are excused but remain responsible for missed material.

> **Note:** University policy states that students who miss one-third or more of class sessions will automatically fail the course.

## Assignments

Weekly assignments help you apply and integrate course concepts. Assignments prepare students for exams and projects.

- Submit assignments through Moodle unless otherwise instructed.  
- Late work is accepted up to **48 hours late with a 10% penalty**, unless otherwise noted.  
- Notify the instructor in cases of extreme hardship.  
- Grades will be posted on Moodle. Review your work and report discrepancies promptly.

### Programming Tools

- **Python 3** will be used for coding assignments.
- **Thonny IDE** (recommended offline editor): <https://thonny.org/>  
- **Replit** (online environment for HTML/CSS and Python): <https://replit.com/>  
- **Google Colab** (Python examples): <https://colab.google/>  
- **GitHub** (hosting web pages): <https://github.com/>

## Discussion Questions

Most weeks include required discussion questions with a dedicated forum.

- Post answers by **Friday at 5:00 pm**.  
- Late postings do not receive credit.  
- Some weeks may require a second post.  
- Students are encouraged to respond to peers, ask questions, and share insights and resources.

Posts should demonstrate critical thinking and original perspectives.

## Academic Honesty and Plagiarism

Integrity is essential. Plagiarism includes submitting work that is not your own, copying answers, failing to cite sources, using AI when prohibited, or treating individual assignments as group work.

Consequences may include a failing assignment grade, failure of the course, and referral to the Academic Dean.

Plagiarism is using another’s ideas, information, or wording without proper acknowledgment. All quoted, paraphrased, or summarized material must be cited. Common knowledge is the only exception.

---

## AI Statement

This course permits AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Grammarly) to assist with learning and development.

Students may use AI to:
- Understand concepts  
- Receive feedback on writing  
- Debug code  
- Generate practice problems  

Students must understand and be able to explain all submitted work. AI tools are **not allowed on exams**.

Assignments will include AI usage guidelines:
- **Red:** No AI use  
- **Yellow:** Limited/cautious use  
- **Green:** AI freely allowed  

Improper AI use is considered cheating and/or plagiarism.
