## Grading

Each course component is worth a specific number of points. The percentage of total points determines the final grade. 
The instructor reserves the right to adjust assignments and points while maintaining overall percentage weightings.

| Component                         | Points | Percent |
|-----------------------------------|--------|---------|
| Participation                     | 100    | 10%     |
| Weekly Assignments (x14)          | 450    | 45%     |
| Exams (x3)                        | 450    | 45%     |
| **Total**                         | **1000** | **100%** |

### Grading Scale

## Active Course Engagement

Active Course Engagement is vital for success in this course. Weekly readings and videos present the course material and provide the background needed to complete assignments and prepare for exams. Students are responsible for reading all assigned materials, viewing the course videos, and communicating any questions through email, text, or during office hours. Students are encouraged to take notes summarizing topics covered in readings, videos, and class sessions (in-person).

Most weeks include required **Discussion Questions** in a Moodle discussion forum. Completion is part of your Active Course Engagement grade. Posts should show critical thinking and original perspectives. Some weeks require a second post. Responding to peers is encouraged. All conversations must be respectful. See Moodle for deadlines. Late posts do not receive credit. 

**Active Course Engagement grades** are recorded after each exam: 30 points after Exam #1, 30 points after Exam #2, and 40 points after Exam #3. Scores are based on attendance and in-class work (in-person only), weekly assignments, discussion posts, a participation self-reflection, and the instructor’s observations.

All students are encouraged to utilize office hours and send questions via email and text.

### Attendance (In-Person Only)

In-person class sessions enable you to engage with the material, providing opportunities to ask questions, participate in discussions, and work through assignments with instructor support.

Attendance is recorded at the beginning of class. Late arrivals or early departures may be treated as partial or full absences. Do not attend class if you are sick. Students are expected to attend all class sessions, arrive on time, stay actively engaged, complete all in-class assignments, refrain from using phones/computers for non-course purposes, and remain in class for the whole session (breaks are permitted only for emergencies). 

*Huntington University policy requires students to attend at least two-thirds (2/3) of scheduled class sessions in a face-to-face course. **Students who miss one-third or more of class meetings will automatically fail the course.** This total includes excused absences for athletics, music, other university activities, or illness. Students are responsible for all material they miss.*

*Note (Room 175): If you arrive late or need to leave early, use the door opposite the instructor workstation and do so quietly. Attending part of a session is better than missing entirely.*

If you miss class, please get in touch with Prof. Lehman. Students who miss multiple sessions may be referred to Student Services, the Dean’s Office, or the Registrar for support.

- Late work is accepted up to **48 hours late with a 10% penalty**, unless otherwise noted.  
- Notify the instructor in cases of extreme hardship.  
- Grades will be posted on Moodle. Review your work and report discrepancies promptly.

### Programming Tools

- **Python 3** will be used for coding assignments.
- **Thonny IDE** (recommended offline editor): <https://thonny.org/>  
- **Replit** (online environment for HTML/CSS and Python): <https://replit.com/>  
- **Google Colab** (Python examples): <https://colab.google/>

## Academic Honesty and Plagiarism

Integrity is essential. Plagiarism includes submitting work that is not your own, copying answers, failing to cite sources, using AI when prohibited, or treating individual assignments as group work.

Consequences may include a failing assignment grade, failure of the course, and referral to the Academic Dean.

Plagiarism is using another’s ideas, information, or wording without proper acknowledgment. All quoted, paraphrased, or summarized material must be cited. Common knowledge is the only exception.

---

## AI Statement

This course permits AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Grammarly) to assist with learning and development.

Students may use AI to:
- Understand concepts  
- Receive feedback on writing  
- Debug code  
- Generate practice problems  

Students must understand and be able to explain all submitted work. AI tools are **not allowed on exams**.

Assignments will include AI usage guidelines:
- **Red:** No AI use  
- **Yellow:** Limited/cautious use  
- **Green:** AI freely allowed  

Improper AI use is considered cheating and/or plagiarism.
